# Docusaurus site (website)

This folder contains a minimal Docusaurus scaffold for the `My-Tech-Knowledge-Base` docs.

Quick start (bash on Windows):

```bash
# from repository root
cd website
npm install
npm run start
```

Build static site:

```bash
npm run build
npm run serve
```

Notes:

- Replace the placeholder files in `website/docs/` with your Markdown content.
- The sidebar is autogenerated from the `docs/` folder structure. Edit `website/sidebars.js` if you want a custom order.
- `docusaurus.config.js` contains `editUrl` seed pointing to the `website/docs` path in this repo.

GitHub Pages note:

- The workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` will build the site and deploy `website/build` to the `gh-pages` branch when you push to `main`.
- If you plan to use GitHub Pages as a project site (https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/), set `baseUrl` in `website/docusaurus.config.js` to `'/My-Tech-Knowledge-Base/'` (the repo name with leading and trailing slashes). For a user/organization site (served at https://<username>.github.io/) keep `baseUrl: '/'`.
