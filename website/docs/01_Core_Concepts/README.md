title: Core Concepts

Placeholder for Core Concepts. Move or copy your Markdown notes from `01_Core_Concepts/` into this folder. Example files:

- `getting-started.md`
- `architecture.md`

Be sure to add frontmatter title fields to Markdown files (optional but recommended) and update internal links if they are relative.
